ProcTHOR procedurally generates interactive, diverse, and semantically plausible houses that are compatible with AI2-THOR.

## Example

Example:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD
python scripts/example.py
```

## Citation

This code is used to generate houses for the [ProcTHOR](https://procthor.allenai.org/) paper:
